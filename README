Stanford Online Course - Introduction to Machine Learning (ML)
-------------------------------------------------------------

This repository holds text notes in LaTeX format and code to the excercises of the Stanford Online
course "Introduction to Machine Learning" which was started for the first time in fall 2011.

The idea behind this repository is not intended to encourage cheating, but rather to help other
students of this course to get comprehensive notes and code to better understand the problems at
hand.

Should you encounter any errors, typos or other problems please contact the author(s) directly in
the Maintainers file or by forking this repository on Github and sending a pull request for patches

Good Luck and happy studying!
